    <h1>To the love of my life</h1>
    <p class="hint"> What are you looking at? Start reading!.</p>

    <div class="paper">
My lovely Amir, I can't help but always think about you and smile throughout days. You are my gem, my lovely man: handsome, charming, real jocular one, compelling, alluring, seeker of truth or debater, go and goal-getter, diligent, charismatic, tenacious, considerate, self-reliant, prudent, imaginative, a born leader (you won't agree, but truly for me), party-loving and a passionate dancer, authentic and genuine, enhancing, imperturbable (aka nonchalant sigma), astute, witty, ingenious, sexy, manly, seductive, dashing, rugged, a smoke show, a fine hottie, cutiepie, devoted -- simply the best!

I always cherish lots of moments we spend together - I don’t want them to end, and I wish time stopped in Kotelniki while we are on Saturdays and Sundays . I am grateful for your love, caring, kindness, attentiveness, support, motivation, inspiration, everything - how you make me loved, smarter, cuter, drunk (with your neck kisses) and, most important, happier!

I wish us to spend more time together hanging out rather than doing homework and diploma. I will be always by you side, supporting your ideas (even like AI girlfriend, as you see), pointing out some moral side of life things (in case if I won't be totally amoral, who knows?), laughing from your jokes (and if you will go stand up, I will be rooting for you), dancing with you at parties, and even listening on the background military summary... 

I wish next year together we will travel and experience more cool things, grow and inspire each other to be better versions of ourselves, also enjoy playing board games and a lot more to say. I am so happy and lucky that you are my lover.

I love you very much! Happy Valentine's Day, my love, xoxo.
